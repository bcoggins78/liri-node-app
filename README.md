# LIRI Bot

### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 10 Homework Project


This week introduced the use of NodeJS and gave us our first taste of backend web development.  

The LIRI Bot uses NodeJS to perform querys from three different APIs and displays the results in the terminal

This project uses:

* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* Moment
* Axios
* Node-Spotify-API
* DotEnv

#### Instructions

To use this app, there are four parameters that will need to be used.

- concert-this
- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
- do-what-it-says

Using the parameter + the search items will bring back the desired results.  If no search item is used with "spotify-this-song" then it will default to "The Sign" by "Ace of Base".  Also, if nothing is used with "movie-this", then it will default to "Mr. Nobody".  All search results and commands are written to the log.txt file.  Example screenshots are below.
